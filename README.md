# My-Portfolio

## About
My first portfolio, I built it with plain old HTML and CSS. No frameworks were utilized, I did use the Google Maps api to style up a map
for the contact page and the wonderful Font-Awesome for my icons! All javascript pertaining to the map is inlined for a hasty render.
The logo on the menu was made with Illustrator by yours truly.
